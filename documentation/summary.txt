MAIN REMARKS ABOUT OUR SIMULATION:
- 41 customizable parameters
- 66 metrics
- Most metrics confirm that our parameters are being implemented
- Trained 100 iterations for 2 1/4 weeks each
- Units of time are in minutes
- Priority queues implemented
- Priority can change twice throughout the SIMULATION
- Exponential distribution for all waiting times
- Max capacity (of 50 in reception waiting line) implemented
- Early queue abandoment if not-priority
- Financial analysis of the simulation 
- Contains warm-up period
